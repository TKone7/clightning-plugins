# clightning-plugins

This is a collection of my own C-Lightning plugins. A short description can be found here - more details in the respective folder. Any recommendations and improvements are very welcome as I am still learning a lot.

| Plugin        | Short Description           | 
| :------------- |:-------------| 
| [fund_wallet](https://github.com/TKone7/clightning-plugins/tree/master/fund_wallet) | Simple command that uses the Bity API to buy sats for fiat. Uses the private key to sign, therefore, needs no further authentication or KYC (till CHF ~5000 / day)  |
| [dumpgraph](https://github.com/TKone7/clightning-plugins/tree/master/dumpgraph)      | Writes all channels from local view in a tab delimited file. | 
| [LnTelegramBot](https://github.com/TKone7/clightning-plugins/tree/master/LnTelegramBot)      | Telegrambot that notifies (only) me about events of my node. |
